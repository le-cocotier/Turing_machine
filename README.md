# Turing machine

It is a primary Turing machine and perhaps not very complete.

# Operation

There are 2 files on the github: 
- a __python__ file
- a __txt__ file

__You have to place it on the same repertory__

# Main.py

It's the main file with the fonctionnement. __You must not modify it__.

# Prgm.txt

There's a simple addition program to test the machine. However, if you want to execute your own program, you just have to replace the program with your own.

# Running

The program request you 2 things:
- the tape
- the initial state

After that the program print the final tape.
